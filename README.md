# FungalPopgenSMGC

Scripts and workflows for identifying intraspecific variants in secondary metabolic gene clusters in fungi.

Intended to be companion to:

Lind AL, Wisecaver JH, Lameiras C, Wiemann P, Palmer JM, et al. (2017) Drivers of genetic diversity in secondary metabolic gene clusters within a fungal species. PLOS Biology 15(11): e2003583. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2003583

Scripts assumbe Python 2, 2.7 or later, with BioPython installed. If you don't already have this, I recommend anaconda or miniconda to manage your Python installation.

All scripts presented as-is. Not optimized for different data types. Your input might break it. [Relevant xkcd.](https://xkcd.com/2054/)
